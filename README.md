# Office Suite Demo for Git

[Git][gitbook] is a distributed version control system designed by
Linus Torvald to track changes to the source code (predominantly
[C][c]). Since these files are plain text generally written with one
statement per line, the natural way to track changes is *one line*,
i.e., everything you type up until you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Office suites (Microsoft, Google, Corel, OpenOffice, LibreOffice) are
neither source code nor plain text. Modern office documents are
structured collections of objects, typically organized as XML stanzas
using plain text ([ASCII][ascii] or [Unicode][utf8]) for headings and
metadata, with the text, images, tables, links, and data that you
type, paste, and compute stored as binary blobs generated from an
often-proprietary encoding.

Practically speaking, this means that although you can use Git to
track changes in your Word documents (*et cetera*), it will not be
efficient: every time you change a character, Git sees it as a change
to the entire binary blob (which contains no line-endings  inside).
To track the change, Git stores the *entire blob*, even if only one
single character was changed in the office software.

The purpose of this repository is to test and interrogate this as an
educational tool.

## Microsoft Word: DOCX

The file [microsoft-word.docx](microsoft-word.docx) contains a copy
of the above README text. The original README is plain text: the
`.md` extension lets the reader know that it was formatted by the
author using [Markdown][md], but the file contains only ASCII text.
You can verify this using `cat` from a Linux or macOS shell, or
`Get-Content` from a Windows PowerShell:

* Linux or macOS shell:

  ```shell
  cat README.md
  ```

* Windows PowerShell:

  ```powershell
  Get-Content .\README.md
  ```

* Output:

  ```output

### Print the Word document in the terminal

The Microsoft Word document is not plain text, which we can verify by
attempting to print it out in raw form. I recommend using `head` to
limit the number of lines it will print:

* Linux or macOS shell:

  ```shell
  head -n 2 microsoft-word.docx
  ```

* Windows PowerShell:

  ```powershell
  Get-Content -Head 2 .\microsoft-word.docx
  ```

* Output:

  ```output
  C;TRZ>[Content_Types].xml (MN0by[%nY vlLR
                                         ǶXp$$i#Jh̼2|OaQ;Q:

### Hexadecimal view of the Word document

For a closer look, you can use a hexadecimal tool like `xxd`
(pre-installed for Linux and macOS, [available for Windows][xxd]) to
dump the raw data to your terminal, rather than having your shell
attempt to convert the data to text:

```shell
xxd microsoft-word.docx | head
```

```output

> #### What's in a hex dump?

> A "hex dump" reads binary data (a sequence of bits representing

> Columns two through nine show `8×4 = 32` hexadecimal values or
> 128 bits (4 bits per hex) of data from the file. The tenth column

The `C;TRZ` string is familiar from the `cat` output, but the really
interesting thing here is that first eight values: `50 4b 03 04`.
This is a [magic number][magic] or file signature, and it corresponds
to the [ZIP file format][zip], a common means of archiving and
compressing data.

### List the Word archive contents

We can use the `unzip` tool to list its contents:

```shell
unzip -l microsoft-word.docx
```

```output
Archive:  microsoft-word.docx
  Length      Date    Time    Name
---------  ---------- -----   ----
     1306  2022-01-27 08:16   [Content_Types].xml
     9853  2018-04-02 17:49   word/theme/theme1.xml
     2576  2022-01-27 08:24   word/settings.xml
     1277  2022-01-27 08:16   word/fontTable.xml
      497  1980-01-01 00:00   word/webSettings.xml
      679  2022-01-27 08:24   docProps/app.xml
      628  2022-01-27 08:24   docProps/core.xml
    32672  2022-01-27 08:24   word/styles.xml
    12976  2022-01-27 08:24   word/document.xml
      577  2022-01-27 08:16   _rels/.rels
     1781  2022-01-27 08:24   word/_rels/document.xml.rels
---------                     -------
    64822                     11 files
```

This confirms that, hiding behind a `docx` extension, we have a
single `.zip` archive compressing almost a dozen XML files from
63 kB (64,822 bytes) down to 13 kB.

### Get the plain text

Looking at the archived file names, it looks like a lot of
boilerplate for settings, fonts, etc. One file, `word/document.xml`,
has some potential interest. The original README text was a handful
of paragraphs, so it should be tidy and easy to read. Let's extract
that XML file, alone, and take a look:

```shell
unzip microsoft-word.docx word/document.xml
```

```output
Archive:  microsoft-word.docx
  inflating: word/document.xml
```

```shell
cat word/document.xml
```

```output
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?><w:document xmlns:wpc="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/word/2010/wordprocessingCanvas" xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006" xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" xmlns:r="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships" xmlns:m="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/math" xmlns:v="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml" xmlns:wp14="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/word/2010/wordprocessingDrawing"
«truncated to prevent bleeding from the eyes»
```

Inspecting the output, I am struck by two things:

1. I recognize some lines from README in the middle of the text dump!
   This is indeed the right file to dig inspect.
2. There are no line endings. While XML is a structured markup
   language that supports tidy organization by breaking lines where
   tags end (`<tag> ... text ... </tag>`<kbd>Enter</kbd>), this file
   was dumped as one un-interrupted line.

   That is not great for Git's line-at-a-time tracking.
